# Equal Divisions of the Octave

If you are using an equal division of the octave less than or equal to 72, at least one standard notation has been defined for it. Many more above 72 have been defined as well. You can find your notation here and then be on your way.

For most EDOs, a single standard exists. For some, you have two options: a native-fifth notation or a subset notation.
