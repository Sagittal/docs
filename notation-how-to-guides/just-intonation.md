# Just Intonation

Four different standard JI notations have been defined, in a gradation of precision levels. A higher precision level means more accuracy, but also more symbols to learn. Simply choose a precision level, gather the JI ratios in your tuning, plug them into the notation calculator, and receive your notation. To notate your tuning exactly, you may not need a high precision level.
