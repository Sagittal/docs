# Quick-Start Guide

## Step 1: Find a standard notation

Sagittal has defined a number of standard notations, and almost certainly one of them will be satisfactory for notating your tuning.

Here are links to standard notations for the most popular tunings:

{% page-ref page="notation-how-to-guides/equal-divisions-of-the-octave.md" %}

{% page-ref page="notation-how-to-guides/12-relative-trojan.md" %}

If you are looking for the Sagittal notation which most closely resembles other popular microtonal notations such as EHEJIPN and Johnston, you are looking for Prime Factor notation:

When possible, you should use a standard notation. 

* Lean on their carefully considered design. 
* Leverage conventions of  the microtonal community.

In the unlikely event that you are unsatisfied with any of the standard notations, however, you are welcome to develop your own Sagittal notation. Please seek advice on the [Sagittal Forum](http://forum.sagittal.org).
