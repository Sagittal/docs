### apotome

### apotome complement

### apotome slope

### arc

A type of [flag](glossary.md#arc), and thus a [symbol element](glossary.md#symbol-element).

### Athenian

The name of the second [symbol set](glossary.md#symbol-set), and thus the first [extension](glossary.md#extension).

### barb

A type of [flag](glossary.md#arc), and thus a [symbol element](glossary.md#symbol-element).

### capture zone

### comma

The word comma has two meanings in Sagittal:

1. It is the general term for any of the small pitch intervals which Sagittal symbols represent.
2. It is also the specific term for one of the seven size categories of these pitch intervals \(the one exactly in the middle, with three on either side\).

The seven size categories of commas represented by Sagittal symbols are, in order from smallest to largest: schismina, schisma, kleisma, comma, small diesis, medium diesis, and large diesis. Size is the only criterion for these categories. Each boundary between categories is defined by the square root of a meaningful 3-limit comma.

The specific category that is called comma has a lower boundary of 11.730¢ and an upper boundary of 33.382¢.

A type of [symbol element](glossary.md#symbol-element). Every

### prime exponent vector

Also known as a _harmonic space coordinate_, a prime interval vector expresses a rational number in a form which makes it immediately clear how many of each prime number it is composed of.

Each term of a prime interval vector corresponds to a different prime. Unless otherwise specified, the first term corresponds to the first prime, 2, the second term corresponds to the second prime, 3, and so on for the remaining terms: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. 

The value of each term is the exponent to which you should raise that prime. The rational number is calculated, then, by taking each term of the vector, raising its corresponding prime to that power, and then multiplying all of these values together.

Let's look at an example. One syntonic comma up in ratio form looks like 81/80. In prime interval vector form, that same rational number looks like \| -4 4 -1 &gt;. This is because 2⁻⁴ × 3⁴ × 5⁻¹ = 81/80. 

Considering the numerator and denominator separately may be helpful. When the ratio is in reduced form, as 81/80 is, when you prime factorize both the numerator and the denominator, no prime found in one will also be found in the other. So you should always first get your ratio into reduced form. From there, you can simply take the counts of each prime in the numerator's factorization and make those into positive exponents, and conversely, take the counts of each prime in the denominator's factorization and make those negative. 81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 3⁴, so that gives us the value of 4 for the term of 3. 80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 2⁴ × 5¹, but for these powers we must make them negative so they will contribute to the denominator instead of the numerator.

A prime interval vector can leave off at any point, beyond which the remaining terms are implied to be 0 \(just as you might leave off the trailing zeros when representing 5/4 as a decimal 1.2; there is no need to write 1.20000000...\).

### symbol element

Each Sagittal symbol is built out of at least two symbol elements. Three types of symbol elements exist: [shafts](glossary.md#shaft), [flags](glossary.md#flag), and [diacritics](glossary.md#diacritic). 

Every Sagittal symbol has at least one shaft, and at least one flag or diacritic. No Sagittal symbol has more than four shafts, three flags, or three diacritics.

### symbol set

In total Sagittal provides ??? symbols, broken up into seven sets. One set is the base set, called the [Spartan](glossary.md#spartan-symbol-set) set.

### tina

### Trojan

### whole tone

An interval the size of one [apotome](glossary.md#apotome) plus one [limma](glossary.md#limma).
