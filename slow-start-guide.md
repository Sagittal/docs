# Slow-Start Guide

Have some time to dig in? Here's one suggested path forward:

### Step 1. Concepts

Start by reading through the pages here on Sagittal concepts. They are not cumulative, so you can pick them up in any order you please.

### Step 2. Notations

Next, familiarize yourself with the standard notations for popular tunings. Understanding how Sagittal concepts come together in different ways depending on the tuning will be a good test of your new knowledge.

### Step 3. History

The main site for Sagittal is a treasure trove of fun and historical documents. The original Xenharmonik√¥n article in particular is dense with insights about how and why the Sagittal notation was developed.

### Step 4. Practice

Eventually we hope to have virtual flashcards for symbols, commas, apotome complements, flavor equivalents, Sagispeak spellings, and more.

### Step 5. Community

Join the forum for discussion and inspiration. We want to hear your ideas about Sagittal.
