# Why Sagittal

Sagittal is more than a single microtonal notation. Unlike other popular microtonal notations which are designed for one particular tuning — such as extended just intonation, or 72EDO — Sagittal is capable of representing almost any microtonal tuning. In this sense, Sagittal is a microtonal notation system which makes possible many different microtonal notations. 

If you write microtonal music in a variety of tunings and are looking for a single notation system which illuminates their shared underlying principles, then Sagittal is for you. 

If you only ever plan to read or write microtonal music in a single tuning, and another notation has been developed specifically for that tuning, you may find you prefer that notation. But you just as well may find that you prefer Sagittal's notation for that tuning anyway.
